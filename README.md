# **Project Overview**

AtliQ Hardware is rapidly expanding its operations, and to gain a competitive edge in the market and make data-driven decisions, the company has undertaken the implementation of data analytics using PowerBi for the first time. This project aims to provide comprehensive insights for stakeholders across various domains, including finance, sales, marketing, and supply chain management.

## **Project Details**

I worked on this project following the Codebasics PowerBi Course, which provided valuable insights and guidance. The link to the course can be found here.

### **Business Related Terms**

Gaining familiarity with terms including but not limited to:

- Gross price
- Pre-invoice deductions
- Post-Invoice deductions
- Net Invoice sale
- Gross Margin
- Net sales
- Net profit
- COGC - cost of goods sold
- YTD - Year to Date
- YTG - Year to Go
- Direct

### **Dataset Understanding**

Before delving into the analysis, a comprehensive understanding of the available dataset was crucial. The dataset comprises:
Dimension Table

    `gdb041`:
        dim_customer: 27 distinct markets, 75 customers, 2 types of platforms, 3 channels.
        dim_market: 27 distinct markets, 7 sub-zones, 4 regions.
        dim_product: Divisions, categories, and product variants.
        fact_forecast_monthly: Table for forecasting customer needs.
        fact_sales_monthly: Table containing sold quantities.
    `gdb056`:
        freight_cost: Details of travel costs per market.
        gross_price: Details of gross prices with product code.
        manufacturing_cost: Details of manufacturing costs with product code and year.
        Pre_invoice_dedutions: Details of pre-invoice deductions with customer and year.
        Post_invoice_deductions: Details of post-invoice deductions and related information.
        
## Importing data into PowerBi

As the database is MySQL in this project, we need to import the datasets from Mysql database to PowerBi by providing the Database access credential

## Data Model

- Data modeling serves as a crucial foundation for the report, playing a pivotal role in its construction. All visualizations are built upon this data model, making its integrity and structure vital for accurate insights.

- Effective data modeling is imperative as poor practices can significantly impact the overall performance of the report. To ensure high-quality modeling, adhering to best practices is essential.

- For this project, we have implemented the Snowfall data modeling method, leveraging its strengths to optimize our analytical approach.
